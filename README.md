# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 
This analysis outlines the performance of all the high schools in a particular school district. There was suspected cheating in one of the schools (Thomas High School 9th grade class). Therefore, the inital performance results had to be modify in order to disqualify the bad data set. There are 2 Juypter notebooks in this repo one that modify the school district performance data by dropping the bad data and one for before the data was removed. The analysis is mainly focused on the following areas:

- School Type
- Grade Level 
- Size of School
- School Budget Per Student 
- Testing Scores: Reading and Math
